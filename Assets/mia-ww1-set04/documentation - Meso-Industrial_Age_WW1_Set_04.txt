Meso-Industrial Age WW1 Set 04

The included Photoshop workfiles contain layers indicating the uv-mapping, so new diffuse maps with different colours can be easily created.

The models do not contain any animation tracks.

The tank thread models are seperate and the corresponding part of the texture map is seamless.
